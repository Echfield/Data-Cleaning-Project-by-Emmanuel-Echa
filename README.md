# Data-Cleaning-Project-by-Emmanuel-Echa
 This is a Data cleaning project carried out in Python 2 by Emmanuel Echa. I am very aware of the myriad of libraries that comes with using Python 3, but not withstanding, I started from the rudiments of Python 2 to get familiar with its far surpasing libraries and its legacy framework that will be referenced for a long time to come.  Python 3 on the other hand will be easy to migrate to as the syntax between Python 2 and 3 remains the same with only few changes which will be encountered along the process of migration for a Data Scientist.   The data that is used for this data cleaning project contains 5000+ movie data scraped from IMDB website. This project is not based on a competition motive, but for educational purposes and referencing for the public space. The data is being exported to a csv format, and it contains information on the actors, directors, budget, and gross,  as well as the IMDB rating and release year.
